# Recon-Redo
*WIP, early stage, coded by a moron*
Adds an upgrade line for Scout units. Enables them to build the Watchtower improvement.  An attempt to take the best ideas from other scout mods and improve where they fail to meet my vision of what scouts should be.

<h3>Units</h3>
Creates a recon unit line which includes an upgraded version of the scout for each era:\
ALL ERAS - All Recon units\
Ignores terrain cost\
[-100]% Strength \<vs cities> \<when attacking>\
Unable to capture cities\
Never appears as a Barbarian unit\
Can build [Watchtower] improvements on tiles\

ANCIENT - Tracker
Cannot attack <before adopting [Honor]>


CLASSICAL - Scout\
Can see over obstacles\
[5] HP when healing <when above [50] HP>

MEDIEVAL - Mounted Scout\
Movement: 2\
Double movement in [plains]\
Double movement in [grassland]\
Double movement in [tundra]

RENAISSANCE - Outrider\
Movement: 2\

INDUSTRIAL - Explorer\
Movement: 2\
